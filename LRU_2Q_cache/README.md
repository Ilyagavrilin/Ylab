# LRU_2Q and ideal cache comparsion
Thise project - realization of LRU_2Q algorithm, and comparsion with ideal cache (base Belady`s algorithm).  
Realization prepared as homework for 2-nd course Ylab course.  
Link to idea of LRU_2Q algorithm: https://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF .  
All tests were on Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS .
## Compilation
You can compile programm with command: `make all`, and call it: `./cache`.
## Built-in debug mode
To compile in debug mode: `make debug`, and call it: `./cache`.   
Demonstrates dump of cache`s lists each step (request).
